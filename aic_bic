AIC (Akaike Information Criterion) and BIC (Bayesian Information Criterion)

Both AIC and BIC are used to evaluate the goodness of fit of statistical models while penalizing for model complexity. Lower values of AIC or BIC indicate a better-fitting model.

What They Do:

AIC: Measures the quality of a model relative to others, with a penalty for the number of parameters in the model. It's used to balance model fit and complexity.

Formula: 

 is the number of parameters.

 is the likelihood of the model.


Lower AIC values indicate a better model fit.


BIC: Similar to AIC but penalizes more strongly for the number of parameters, which helps avoid overfitting when comparing models.

Formula: 

 is the number of data points.


Like AIC, lower BIC values indicate a better model.



Ranges for AIC/BIC and Interpretation:

AIC/BIC values don't have a specific absolute "range" like p-values or ADF statistics. Instead, they're relative to different models.

The model with the lowest AIC/BIC value is preferred.

A difference of 10 or more between models is considered substantial.



Example Interpretation:

AIC = -3448, BIC = -3430:

Both values are negative, indicating a relatively good model fit (assuming we're comparing different models).

AIC being lower than BIC: Indicates that the model is well-fitted, but the BIC penalizes more for complexity (BIC tends to favor simpler models).

If AIC and BIC values are close (like in this case), it indicates a balanced model that isn't overfitting.



What if These Values Indicate Poor Fit?

If the AIC and BIC are high (relative to other models) or not good enough, the following actions can help improve the model:

1. Transformation of Data:

If the data is non-stationary, try differencing or applying logarithmic or power transformations.

Handling seasonality explicitly with SARIMA if there are seasonal patterns.



2. Simplifying the Model:

Too many parameters can lead to overfitting (high AIC/BIC). Try reducing the complexity of the model (e.g., reducing AR, MA terms in ARIMA).



3. Adding Exogenous Variables (for SARIMAX):

If there are external factors affecting the series, incorporating them as exogenous variables might improve the fit.



4. Re-evaluating Lag Structure:

Incorrect lag lengths in time series models can lead to a poor fit. Adjust lags based on autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation plots.



5. Regularization:

In some cases, applying regularization techniques like LASSO can help reduce overfitting by shrinking coefficients of less important features.




In summary, the AIC and BIC are both tools for comparing models. In your case, with AIC = -3448 and BIC = -3430, it seems the model is performing well (since lower is better), but there's a slight complexity penalty from BIC. If needed, simplifying the model could further reduce the BIC value.
