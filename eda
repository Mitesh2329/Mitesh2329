Here’s a concise overview of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) in Python, suitable for two slides in layman’s terms:

Slide 1: What is Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Why Do We Do It?

What is EDA?

EDA is the process of analyzing datasets to summarize their main characteristics, often using visual methods.

It helps us understand the patterns, trends, and relationships in the data before applying more complex models.


Why Do We Do It?

Gain Insights: Discover underlying patterns and trends that inform decision-making.

Identify Relationships: Understand how different variables interact with each other.

Detect Anomalies: Spot outliers or unusual data points that may affect analysis.

Guide Data Preparation: Help determine what preprocessing is needed for further analysis or modeling.

Slide 2: Methods of EDA in Python

1. Summary Statistics

Use describe() to get an overview of central tendencies (mean, median), spread (standard deviation, quartiles), and counts.


2. Data Visualization

Histograms: Visualize the distribution of numerical data using matplotlib or seaborn.

Box Plots: Identify outliers and visualize the spread of data.

Scatter Plots: Explore relationships between two numerical variables.


3. Correlation Analysis

Correlation Matrix: Use corr() to see relationships between variables and visualize it with heatmaps.


4. Grouping Data

Group By: Use groupby() to summarize data based on specific categories and calculate aggregate statistics.


5. Missing Values Analysis

Visualize missing values using libraries like missingno to understand data completeness.
