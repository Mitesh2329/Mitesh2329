Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM) is a mathematical model that describes the random movement of a value over time, incorporating both a consistent upward or downward trend and unpredictable fluctuations. It ensures that values (like asset prices) can never go below zero, making it useful for modeling financial assets.

Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM) - Simple Stats Explanation:

1. Random Movement with Growth: GBM models the random movement of a value (like an asset price) over time, but with an underlying assumption that the value has a steady upward or downward trend. It accounts for both the randomness (like market fluctuations) and a consistent drift (growth or decay), making it a popular way to describe stock prices or other financial assets.


2. Log-Normal Distribution: In GBM, the percentage changes (or returns) of the value are normally distributed, meaning the actual values follow a log-normal distribution. This ensures that the value never goes negative, which is important for financial assets or balances, as they can't fall below zero.



Why Use GBM for Modeling Non-Maturing Deposits (NMD):

Captures Random and Trend Movements: GBM effectively models non-maturing deposits because balances fluctuate over time due to customer behavior, interest rates, or economic conditions. GBM allows for randomness in these changes while considering a long-term trend (either growth or decay).

Effective for Long-Term Projections: Since non-maturing deposits don't have a fixed maturity, GBM's ability to handle uncertainty in future balances while accounting for gradual trends makes it a powerful tool for forecasting and stress testing deposit balances over time. This helps banks manage liquidity and predict future cash flow from these deposits.
