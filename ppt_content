Slide 1: Features - Log-Normal Distribution and Decay Analysis for NMDs

Key Modeling Features:

1. Log-Normal Distribution

Used to model balance fluctuations of non-maturing deposits (NMDs), accurately reflecting their non-symmetric nature and volatility patterns.



2. Decay Analysis for NMDs

Applied a decay function to assess how deposits gradually diminish over time, key for identifying stable and volatile portions in liquidity management.



3. Weighted Average Method for TDRR and CPR

A weighted average approach was adopted for TDRR and CPR, ensuring precise runoff behavior, validated against client-specific needs and market conditions.




This flexible model offers precise insights into liquidity risk and can be tailored for different deposit portfolios.

Slide 2: Functionality - PL/SQL Implementation

PL/SQL Execution:

1. Joins and Subqueries

Used to effectively combine data across multiple tables, ensuring data accuracy and efficient computation of key metrics.



2. Custom Functions and Procedures

Developed functions and procedures to compute log-normal distribution, decay rates, TDRR, and CPR, ensuring modularity and performance.




The approach was fully integrated into existing systems, providing a scalable and efficient solution.
