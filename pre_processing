Here’s a concise overview of data preprocessing that you can fit into two slides, using layman’s terms:

Slide 1: What is Data Preprocessing and Why Do We Do It?

What is Data Preprocessing?

Data preprocessing is the process of cleaning and organizing raw data to make it suitable for analysis.

It involves transforming data into a format that can be easily understood by algorithms.


Why Do We Do It?

Improve Accuracy: Clean data leads to more accurate models.

Handle Missing Values: Fill in or remove gaps to avoid errors.

Remove Noise: Get rid of irrelevant information that can confuse models.

Standardize Formats: Ensure consistency in data representation, like dates or currency.

Enhance Interpretability: Make data easier to understand for better insights.

Slide 2: Methods of Data Preprocessing in Python

1. Handling Missing Values

Imputation: Filling in missing data with mean, median, or mode.

Dropping: Removing rows or columns with missing values.


2. Data Cleaning

Removing Duplicates: Using drop_duplicates() to eliminate repeated entries.

Filtering Outliers: Identifying and removing extreme values that can skew results.


3. Feature Scaling

Normalization: Rescaling data to a range (0, 1) using Min-Max Scaling.

Standardization: Transforming data to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.


4. Encoding Categorical Variables

Label Encoding: Converting categories into numerical labels.

One-Hot Encoding: Creating binary columns for each category to avoid confusion.


5. Splitting Data

Train-Test Split: Dividing data into training and testing sets using train_test_split() from sklearn.
