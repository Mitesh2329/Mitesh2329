For segmentation of Total Prepayment Rate (TPRR) and Conditional Prepayment Rate (CPR) modeling under Interest Rate Risk in the Banking Book (IRRBB) following Basel guidelines, you can create a master dataset with various variables. These variables will cover customer behavior, product characteristics, macroeconomic factors, and other key risk factors. Below is a comprehensive list of categories and variables that you should consider:

1. Customer Demographics

Age of Borrower

Income Level

Employment Type (Salaried, Self-employed)

Geographic Region

Credit Score

Loan Tenure Remaining

Borrowerâ€™s Asset Holdings

Homeownership Status


2. Loan/Product Characteristics

Loan Type (Mortgage, Auto Loan, Personal Loan, etc.)

Loan Amount

Loan to Value Ratio (LTV)

Interest Rate Type (Fixed, Variable)

Interest Rate Spread (vs. market rate)

Loan Origination Year

Remaining Principal

Amortization Type (Fully amortizing, Interest-only)

Loan Term (e.g., 30 years, 15 years)

Prepayment Penalty (Yes/No)

Rate Reset Date (for variable-rate loans)


3. Macroeconomic Variables

Interest Rates (Current and historical)

Inflation Rate

Unemployment Rate

Gross Domestic Product (GDP) Growth

Housing Price Index (HPI)

Market Volatility (VIX Index)

Economic Sentiment Indicator


4. Behavioral Variables

Seasonality (Prepayment rates may vary by season)

Prepayment Speed (Historical prepayment behavior of similar loans)

Borrower Recency (Time since last prepayment)

Frequency of Early Payments

Prepayment Incentive (Difference between current and market rates)

Borrower Income Growth Rate

Past Prepayment Activity


5. Loan Payment History

Delinquency Status

Number of Late Payments

Payment Frequency (Weekly, Monthly)

Overpayment Patterns (If the borrower makes extra payments)

Partial Prepayments (Yes/No)


6. Loan Purpose

Home Purchase

Refinance

Investment Property

Renovation

Debt Consolidation


7. Prepayment Triggers

Interest Rate Changes (Rate decrease/increase triggers prepayments)

Employment Changes (Job loss, job change)

Divorce/Marriage

Inheritance or Financial Windfall

Relocation


8. Market Conditions

Current Mortgage Rates (vs. historical averages)

Housing Market Liquidity (Ease of selling property)

Mortgage Rate Expectations

Availability of Credit (Ease of refinancing)


9. Institutional Factors

Bank Policies on Early Payments

Regulatory Changes (New rules affecting prepayment penalties)

Government Incentives (Subsidies, tax incentives for prepayment)

Cost of Refinancing (Fees and charges associated with prepayment)

Bank Marketing Offers (Promotions for refinancing)


10. Product Lifecycle Variables

Loan Age (How old is the loan?)

Remaining Loan Tenor

Contractual Maturity

Cohort Year (Year the loan was issued)

Expected Cash Flows (Discounted cash flow projections)


11. Risk-Related Factors

Loan Default Probability (PD)

Expected Loss (EL)

Volatility of Cash Flows (Due to rate fluctuations)

Loan Book Risk Classification (High-risk, medium-risk, low-risk)


12. Prepayment Option Variables

Option Cost (Cost of prepaying loan)

Option Value (Financial value of prepaying early)

Rate Differential (Current loan rate vs. market rate)


13. Time-Dependent Factors

Time to Reprice (for variable-rate loans)

Remaining Interest Rate Lock Period

Loan Age vs. Maturity

Time Since Last Prepayment


14. External Economic Conditions

Availability of Refinancing Options

Government Housing Policies

Consumer Confidence Index

Global Economic Conditions (For countries with foreign borrowers)


15. Basel Regulatory Variables

Risk-Weighted Assets (RWA) Impact

IRRBB-specific stress tests (Prescribed by Basel guidelines)

Prepayment Rate Sensitivity (to interest rate shocks)

Capital Adequacy Ratio Impact

Impact on Earnings at Risk (EaR)

Impact on Economic Value of Equity (EVE)

Basel III Liquidity Ratios (LCR, NSFR)


16. Bank-Specific Historical Data

Prepayment Trends by Loan Type

Historical Prepayment Rates

Prepayment Seasonality

Bank-Specific Prepayment Models

Modeling Approach

K-Means Clustering:

Use demographic, behavioral, loan, and macroeconomic variables to segment borrowers into clusters based on similar prepayment behaviors.

After segmentation, you can analyze the unique characteristics of each cluster and see how they respond to changes in interest rates and other factors.


Decision Tree Algorithm:

Use a decision tree to predict prepayment likelihood (CPR or TPRR) by using the segmented clusters as features and their associated prepayment behavior.

You can identify important splits such as interest rate changes, borrower credit score, or loan age that significantly affect prepayment probabilities.



By capturing these variables across different segments, you will be able to identify the key drivers of prepayment under different interest rate scenarios, as required by Basel IRRBB guidelines.

This comprehensive variable list will help ensure nothing is left out when you build your master dataset for TPRR and CPR modeling.
